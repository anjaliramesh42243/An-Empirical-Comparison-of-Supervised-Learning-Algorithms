# Classification-Model-Comparison


This project is a semi-replication of Caruana and Niculescu-Mizil’s 2006 paper, “An Empirical Comparison of Supervised Learning Algorithms”. The performance of three different supervised machine learning algorithms on binary classification problems across four data sets is compared. The algorithms compared are Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), and K Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The algorithms are tuned using grid searches combined with 5 k-fold cross validation. The optimal fit of each algorithm is analyzed using three different metrics: accuracy, AUC score, and FSC score, which are averaged across five trials per algorithm for each data set.
